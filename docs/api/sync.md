# Synchronize a wallet

Sync downloads and scans data for the wallet's accounts. It is explicit: opening a wallet or consuming a light-client stream does not start a general scan.

```ts
import type { WalletClient } from '@jp4g/zcash.js';

export async function syncWallet(wallet: WalletClient, signal: AbortSignal) {
  const status = await wallet.sync({ signal });
  if (!status.targetReached) return { ready: false, status };
  return { ready: true, status };
}
```

Without a target, the wallet captures a finite target from its light source. You can pass `{ target: { height, hash } }` for a specific chain point. Check `targetReached` before treating a scan as complete. Cancellation can return a stopped status; a resolved promise alone is not a completion claim.

If the source changes a pinned chain point mid-run, sync revalidates the chain and
replans, with at most three source-view attempts. An automatic target may be
recaptured; an explicit target is never replaced. Continued source movement
returns retryable `SYNC_REQUIRED`. Invalid blocks and unexplained native protocol
rejections remain errors; they are not blindly retried.

## Follow scan progress

```ts
import type { SyncStatus, WalletClient } from '@jp4g/zcash.js';

export async function followSync(
  wallet: WalletClient, signal: AbortSignal, render: (status: SyncStatus) => void,
) {
  for await (const status of wallet.watchSync({ signal })) {
    render(status);
    if (status.targetReached) break;
  }
}
```

`watchSync` starts lazily on the first read. Subscribers share background sync; keep consuming to avoid buffer overflow. Returning the last subscriber stops its background watcher. It does not cancel a separately started finite `sync()` operation.

Unspent-address enhancement requires an inventory tied to the scanned tip. If
the source advances beyond the captured target, or changes while the inventory
is read, that request stays pending for a later scan. A finite sync can therefore
reach its captured target with actionable enhancement still outstanding.
`watchSync()` scans newer tips and revisits those requests on later polls.
Explicit historical targets are never advanced just to satisfy enhancement.

You can consume `watchSync()` while awaiting a payment's `wait()`. Payment
observations can invalidate a native scan revision; sync discards the stale plan
and revalidates/replans, with at most three attempts per source-view pass.
Continued contention surfaces `CURSOR_STALE`. No stale plan is accepted, and an
unknown native write completion is not replayed. Payment waiting alone does not
start scanning.

`getSyncStatus()` reads local status without starting network work. Use `scan.fullyScannedHeight`, `scan.scanComplete`, and enhancement progress rather than treating `maxScannedHeight` as complete coverage. A source error, reorganization, or unresolved transaction enhancement can leave useful partial progress.

Only one finite sync runs at a time. For a UI, keep a controller for the active task, cancel it when the user leaves, and close any iterator you create manually.
